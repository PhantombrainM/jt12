`timescale 1ns / 1ps

/* Ideally there should be a multiplication to obtain accurate phase shift
 but for cents < 100 a linear approximation is enough. And this can be further
 done discretely without human noticeable distortion.
 The implementation belove makes a lot of sense from the hardware point of view.
 It agrees with die shots documented by Sauraen on spritesmind.net
 It agrees with MAME's fm.cpp, which is said to agree with real hardware

 Real implementation may have had this done in several clock cycles, but
 this amount of logic is not too much for modern FPGA's to be done
 in a single clock cycle. As noted below, real hardware may have additional
 savings in the LUT, but that strategy wouldn't payoff on an FPGA where half
 used logic elements are wasted.

 Note that MAME's approach requires a 32kByte memory, whereas the same
 is accomplished here with way less hardware.
